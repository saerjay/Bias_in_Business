Analysis of Yelp reviews for systematic bias

Yelp data analyses are a dime a dozen, but you know what isn't? _Conversations about microagressions in McDonalds_. This analysis skims Yelp reviews of major US cities to identify potential manifestations of bias in businesses. Bias_in Businesses wrangles racially coded language in a lexical analysis of reviews, mines for meaningful implicit bias, and points to the potential impact of total prejudice. 

Yelp reviews were analyzed for "bias" language across the US, below is an example from Philadelphia, PA. Run Project1.rmd for additional data on Florida, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Missouri, and major cities for comparison. Random samples from each state were also analyzed to see how different zip codes held against each other.

The result? _Bias is everywhere._

Bohren et al., (2025) recommend a measure of direct, indirect, and total systemic discrimination in order to estimate the total impact of discrimination. A sample of characteristics that potentially lead to indirect socioeconomic bias were identified. The sample below includes whether a business charges corkage fees, requires a formal or classy attire, and if insurance is accepted or not (self-pay). These items were stacked to demonstrate the potential aggregate effect of different forms of discrimination.

Conclusions:
Bias_in_Business aims to start the conversation on discrimination in day-to-day comercial activities. Further study into additional characteristics of businesses, racially coded phrases, and how reviews change over time would be benficial next steps. Companies could use this data to develop a more clear understanding for the social sentiment of their business. As a business owner, it would be beneficial to regularly scan review data for concerning vocabulary or characteristics in order to identify potential harm to the community or gaps in accessibility. A deliverable report that business owners could easily access and download would be useful for these purposes and could be a logical next step.
